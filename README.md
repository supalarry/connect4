# connect4
Goal was to create an algorithm that can attack and defend in game of connect four. Thus, you have a chance to play connect four with an algorithm having an IQ of 300. This project was done in two days for fun. ðŸ˜Š

## Project folder structure
```
connect4
â”œâ”€â”€ includes [header file for project]
â””â”€â”€ srcs [sources of the project]
Makefile [compiles the project]
author [my username]
libft.a [library I built for custom functions]
libft.h [header file of library's functions]
main.c [launcher for the game]
```

## Getting Started
Run **make** and then run executable **Power 4** with an argument for rows and columns aka board size. Minimum is 6 rows and 7 columns. You will now play four in a row against the algorithm.
## It's game time
You simply have to say in which column you would like to drop your piece and that is it!
